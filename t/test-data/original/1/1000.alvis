        <section>Many of you may have noticed that last night Searchblog was hacked, apparently by someone in Albania (!). For a brief period of time my site redirected to a very odd page, and it appeared I had entirely lost my mind. All is well now, though we have some backend housekeeping to do. Thanks to the many readers who alerted me.</section>      </canonicalDocument>
